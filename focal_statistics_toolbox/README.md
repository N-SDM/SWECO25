## SWECO25 Focal Statistics Toolbox

[This toolbox](focal_statistics_SWECO25.tbx) computes focal statistics for each raster layer from the input folder. It outputs a total of 13 raster layers with focal statistics radii ranging from 25m to 5000m. 

Required inputs for this toolbox are:

1. A folder containing one or several raster layers
2. An output folder

The **mean**  value is calculated on a circle with varying radius. 

Below is the representation of the ArcGIS Pro Modelbuilder structure used for this process
