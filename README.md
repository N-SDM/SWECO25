## SWECO25

SWECO25 is a 25-meter resolution raster database gathering XXX layers on 10 main environmental categories for ecological research in Switzerland. 

Layers available in SWECO25 were standardized using a common spatial grid covering all of Switzerland so they all share the same spatial resolution, extent, and projected coordinate reference system. The SWECO25 database includes both the standardized sources and derived layers, such as those obtained by computing focal statistics or distance functions. The SWECO25 database is openly available at XXX.

## Reprocessing template 

Layers were reprocessed to fit the standards of SWECO25 in terms or extent, CRS, resolution and spatial grid. 
A reprocessing code example written in R is available here.
